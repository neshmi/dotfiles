# My dotfiles
These are designed around my workflows and habits.  But, they might work for
you, too. Inspired HEAVILY by @tomafro's dotfiles.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo into `~/.dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
3. Run `./setup.sh`

This will install `brew`, a ton of utilities and programs, and configure the
default shell to be `/usr/local/bin/fish`.

## Private Credentials
No environment would be complete without sensitive info, so stick those into
`~/.private.d/config.fish` and they'll get sourced, too!
